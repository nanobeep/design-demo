  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  
    <article class="faq-answer" id="pricing-for-classic-customers">
      <h2>How much does Basecamp cost? Is there a free plan, or are there any special rates?</h2>
      <p>Basecamp starts as low as $20 a month! You can find plans and pricing <a href="../../pricing/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>There's no free plan for Basecamp; sorry! All plans are priced the same for everyone, even schools and non-profits &ndash; we try to keep things affordable and on a level playing field for everyone. Basecamp is free during your trial period!</p>

<p>Customers using the original version of Basecamp (Basecamp Classic) can use the new Basecamp for free on the equivalent plan, so long as the Classic account is up and running.</p>

<p>Did you know you can <a href="../guides/account/billing-info/index.html">change your Basecamp plan</a> at any time?</p>

    </article>
  
    <article class="faq-answer" id="trial-end">
      <h2>What happens when my trial ends?</h2>
      <p>If your trial ends before you choose a plan, your account will freeze. Your data will remain intact, though inaccessible, until you <a href="../guides/account/pick-a-plan/index.html">choose a plan and add a credit card</a>.</p>

    </article>
  
    <article class="faq-answer" id="how-to-pay">
      <h2>How can I pay for Basecamp?</h2>
      <p>We accept all major credit cards. While we're unable to accept other forms of payment, you can pay for several months in advance via lump sum. <a href="../videos/lump-sum-payments/index.html">Watch this video</a> to see how lump sum payments work!</p>

    </article>
  
    <article class="faq-answer" id="mobile">
      <h2>How do I access Basecamp from my mobile device?</h2>
      <p>Check in on your projects anywhere &ndash; no apps required! Simply <a href="../../index.html">sign in</a> to Basecamp with your phone or tablet&rsquo;s browser and you&rsquo;re all set! <a href="../../mobile/index.html">Find out more</a>, or read the full <a href="../guides/mobile/index.html">Basecamp mobile FAQ</a>.

    </article>
  
    <article class="faq-answer" id="api-token">
      <h2>Where do I find my API token?</h2>
      <p>With the new Basecamp, third-party integrations don't use API tokens like they did with Basecamp Classic. The app you want to use may already be updated to work with the new Basecamp, though! You can see all the current third-party add-ons that work with your account <a href="../../extras/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <article class="faq-answer" id="tech-requirements">
      <h2>What are the technical requirements for using Basecamp?</h2>
      <p>Basecamp is available anywhere you have an internet connection. There's nothing to install, and all you need is a modern web browser. If you're not sure if you've got the right browser, check <a href="../guides/account/browser-requirements/index.html">our guide</a>.</p>

    </article>
  
    <article class="faq-answer" id="customising-basecamp">
      <h2>Can I add a logo or customize Basecamp in any way?</h2>
      <p>At the moment it isn't possible to customize your account or projects with colors, a company logo or a custom URL. We know which accounts you have access to, and let you choose which to enter when you <a href="https://launchpad.37signals.com/basecamp">log in with your username</a>.</p>

<p> Sorry about that!</p>

    <article class="faq-answer" id="templates">
      <h2>Can I create templates for recurring projects?</h2>

    <article class="faq-answer" id="file-versioning">
      <h2>How can I add new versions of a file?</h2>
      <p>Upload the original file like normal to the <a href="../guides/projects/files/index.html">Files section</a>. The revision of that file can be uploaded as a comment on that original file, along with any notes you want to add. This way, you always have the original file and the latest version is always in the most recent comment!</p>
